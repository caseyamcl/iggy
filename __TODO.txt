TODO:

1. Make LESS and SCSS pre-processors fall back to using built-in LESS or SCSS when they are available.
2. Working on Console Commands
3. Docker image (the docker build file actually pulls the latest iggy from github using URL to built PHAR)
   There will be a separate file in 'dist' that is a BASH script.  That script will run something like:
   and then run `docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/srv $@ iggy:latest`
4. Add some useful Twig extensions if you feel like it.
5. In the ROBO script, handle updating the version number (ROBO plugin?)
