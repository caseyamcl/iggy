- A few things to try to fool Twig into regenerating templates per request:
  1. Does simply building a new Twig Environment work?  If not, then...
  2. Consider creating a loader that wraps another loader, and it generates a psuedo-random template name for
     the template for every request, thus making Twig think that the template name is different even though it is the
     same.  For example, add a `--uniqid` to the end of the template name, and then strip it out in the loader.  Dunno.

TODO:

1. Make LESS and SCSS pre-processors fall back to using built-in LESS or SCSS when they are available.
3. Docker image (the docker build file actually pulls the latest iggy from github using URL to built PHAR)
   There will be a separate file in 'dist' that is a BASH script.  That script will run something like:
   and then run `docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/srv $@ iggy:latest`
4. Add some useful Twig extensions if you feel like it.
5. In the ROBO script, handle updating the version number (ROBO plugin?)
